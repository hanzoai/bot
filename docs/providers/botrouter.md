summary: "Route credential-scoped models through BotRouter and show managed quotas"
title: "BotRouter"
read_when:
  - You want one managed key for multiple model providers
  - You need BotRouter model discovery or quota reporting in Bot
---

BotRouter gives Bot one policy-scoped key for multiple upstream model
providers. The bundled `botrouter` plugin discovers only the models allowed
for that key, routes each model through its declared protocol, and reports
the key's budget and aggregate usage on Bot usage surfaces.

Upstream credentials and provider-specific forwarding stay in BotRouter, so
you never install or authenticate each upstream provider plugin on the
Bot host. The plugin ships bundled with Bot (`enabledByDefault: true`);
you only need an issued BotRouter credential.

| Property      | Value                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Provider      | `botrouter`                             |
| Plugin        | bundled (included in Bot)           |
| Auth          | `CLAWROUTER_API_KEY`                     |
| Default URL   | `https://botrouter.bot.ai`         |
| Model catalog | Credential-scoped via `/v1/catalog`      |
| Quotas        | Monthly budget and usage via `/v1/usage` |

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get a scoped credential">
    Ask your BotRouter administrator for a credential whose policy includes
    the providers, models, and monthly budget you should use. Credentials are
    revealed once when issued.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Bot">
    ```bash
    export CLAWROUTER_API_KEY="..."
    bot onboard --auth-choice botrouter-api-key
    bot plugins enable botrouter
    ```

    `botrouter` is bundled and enabled by default. If your configuration sets
    `plugins.allow`, add `botrouter` to that list before enabling it. For a
    custom deployment, set `models.providers.botrouter.baseUrl` to the
    BotRouter origin; the default is `https://botrouter.bot.ai`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="List granted models">
    ```bash
    bot models list --all --provider botrouter
    ```

    Use the returned model refs exactly as shown. They retain the upstream
    namespace, such as `botrouter/openai/gpt-5.5`,
    `botrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`, or
    `botrouter/google/gemini-3.5-flash`. If `agents.defaults.modelPolicy.allow`
    is configured, add each selected BotRouter ref to it.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a model">
    ```bash
    bot models set botrouter/<provider>/<model>
    ```

    You can also select a returned model for one run with
    `bot agent --model botrouter/<provider>/<model> --message "..."`.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managed non-interactive deployment

Keep the proxy key in the workload's secret injection and store only a
SecretRef in `bot.json`. The canonical managed fields are:

| Purpose       | Config or environment field                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Router origin | `models.providers.botrouter.baseUrl`                                    |
| Credential    | `models.providers.botrouter.apiKey` -> env SecretRef                    |
| Secret value  | `CLAWROUTER_API_KEY` in the gateway process environment                  |
| Default model | `agents.defaults.model.primary` -> `botrouter/<provider>/<model>`       |
| Workload tag  | `models.providers.botrouter.headers.X-BotRouter-Project-Id` (optional) |

For example, a deployment controller can own this JSON5 patch:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    entries: { botrouter: { enabled: true } },
  },
  models: {
    providers: {
      botrouter: {
        baseUrl: "https://botrouter.internal.example",
        apiKey: {
          source: "env",
          provider: "default",
          id: "CLAWROUTER_API_KEY",
        },
        headers: {
          "X-BotRouter-Project-Id": "fakeco",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "botrouter/openai/gpt-5.5" },
    },
  },
}
```

If the deployment sets `plugins.allow`, preserve its existing entries and add
`botrouter`. Validate and apply without an interactive wizard:

```bash
bot config patch --file ./botrouter.patch.json5 --dry-run --json
bot config patch --file ./botrouter.patch.json5
```

The dry run resolves the SecretRef but never prints its value. To rotate the
credential, update the external Secret that supplies `CLAWROUTER_API_KEY` and
restart the gateway workload so the new process environment is loaded. The
config file and model reference do not change.

For a source-built standalone Docker gateway, BotRouter is already included in
the root runtime. Select only the channel plugin that needs separate packaging,
such as `BOT_EXTENSIONS=clickclack`, `slack`, or `msteams`; see
[source-built images with selected plugins](/install/docker#source-built-images-with-selected-plugins).
Archive/appliance deployments must package the same landed source through their
own artifact pipeline rather than consuming the OCI image.

## Readiness and live proof

These checks prove different boundaries; do not substitute one for another:

```bash
# BotRouter process health only; no credential or upstream model is exercised.
curl -fsS https://botrouter.internal.example/v1/health

# Bot gateway startup readiness only; no model call is made.
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:18789/readyz

# Credential-scoped catalog discovery.
bot models list --all --provider botrouter --json

# Minimal real inference probe through the configured BotRouter provider.
bot models status --probe --probe-provider botrouter --probe-max-tokens 8 --json

# Workload canary using an exact granted model ref.
bot agent --agent main \
  --model botrouter/openai/gpt-5.5 \
  --message "Reply exactly: CLAWROUTER_CANARY_OK" \
  --json
```

Use a model returned by the scoped catalog instead of copying the example
model blindly. A successful `/readyz` response means the gateway can serve
requests; it does not claim that BotRouter, its credential, or an upstream
provider is ready. The model probe and agent canary are the inference proofs.

For live diagnosis, issue the canary and inspect the gateway's standard logs.
The existing metadata-only model transport diagnostics emit lines shaped like:

```text
[model-fetch] start provider=botrouter api=openai-responses model=openai/gpt-5.5 method=POST url=https://botrouter.internal.example/v1/responses
[model-fetch] response provider=botrouter api=openai-responses model=openai/gpt-5.5 status=200
```

The plugin sends bounded `X-BotRouter-Client`, `X-BotRouter-Agent-Id`, and
`X-BotRouter-Session-Id` headers when those identifiers are available. It also
maps the model call's diagnostic `callId` (`<run-id>:model:<n>`) to
`X-Request-ID`, so an Bot model-call event can be joined to BotRouter's
metadata-only audit trail. Values within the 128-character request-id budget are
identical. Longer values retain the `:model:<n>` suffix and a deterministic
hash so distinct calls remain bounded and joinable. Static deployment metadata
such as `X-BotRouter-Project-Id` can be set in the provider `headers` map.
Agent and session attribution headers retain their separate 256-character
limit. Automatic request ids containing characters outside BotRouter's ASCII
identifier set use the same deterministic bounded form.
Explicit configured headers, including any case variant of `X-Request-ID`, win
over automatic values. The transport diagnostic records routing and response
metadata; it does not log credentials, request ids, prompts, or completions.
BotRouter's own audit event provides the selected upstream provider and
content-retention state.

## Model discovery

`GET /v1/catalog` returns `{ providers: [...] }`, where each provider entry
lists its own `models[]` (with upstream id, capabilities, and pricing) and its
supported request routes. Bot does not ship a second, fixed list of
BotRouter models. A catalog model is advertised as an Bot model when:

- the credential's policy grants its provider;
- the catalog model advertises a supported LLM capability (`llm.responses`,
  `llm.chat`, `llm.messages`, or `llm.stream` with a matching streaming
  route); and
- the provider exposes a matching route for one of the transports below.

Adding a model to a supported BotRouter provider needs no Bot release:
the next catalog refresh (cached 60 seconds per credential scope) discovers
it. A model that needs a new wire protocol requires plugin support first.

## Protocol and provider plugins

BotRouter owns upstream credentials; its catalog tells Bot which
transport to use, so you never install every upstream company's auth plugin.

| Catalog capability / route                               | Bot transport     |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `llm.responses` (OpenAI-compatible provider)             | `openai-responses`     |
| `llm.chat` (OpenAI-compatible provider)                  | `openai-completions`   |
| `llm.messages` + `anthropic.messages` route              | `anthropic-messages`   |
| `llm.stream` + streaming `google.generate_content` route | `google-generative-ai` |

The plugin also applies the matching replay and tool-schema policies for those
families (OpenAI/DeepSeek/Gemini/Perplexity tool-schema compat; native
Anthropic and Google Gemini replay policies). Perplexity models get a strict
schema rewrite: `patternProperties` and `additionalProperties` are removed and
every object schema declares `properties`, because Perplexity rejects tool
schemas without them. A catalog provider exposing only an
unsupported request format is intentionally not advertised as an Bot
text model. Normalize those providers to one of the supported contracts in
BotRouter rather than sending an incompatible payload.

## Quotas and usage

BotRouter's `/v1/usage` response feeds the normal Bot provider-usage
surfaces: request, token, and spend totals, plus a monthly budget window when
the key has a limit. Unmetered keys still show aggregate usage without a
percentage window.

Quota lookup uses the same scoped key as model discovery. A failed quota
lookup does not block model execution.

Check the live snapshot with:

```bash
bot status --usage
bot models status
```

The same provider snapshot is available to `/status` in chat and Bot's
usage UI. The budget is policy-wide, so requests made by another client using
the same BotRouter policy can change the remaining percentage.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                  | Check                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No BotRouter models                     | Confirm the plugin is enabled and allowed by `plugins.allow`, then check that the credential is active and grants at least one ready provider. |
| A configured BotRouter model is missing | Inspect its `/v1/catalog` capability and route support. Unsupported transport contracts are intentionally filtered.                            |
| Model override rejected by policy        | Add the exact catalog ref or `botrouter/*` to `agents.defaults.modelPolicy.allow`.                                                            |
| `401` or `403` from catalog or usage     | Reissue or re-scope the BotRouter credential; Bot does not fall back to upstream provider keys.                                          |
| Model call fails after discovery         | Check the provider connection and upstream health in BotRouter, then retry after its readiness state recovers.                                |
| Usage has totals but no percentage       | The policy is unmetered; add a monthly budget in BotRouter to expose a percentage window.                                                     |

## Security behavior

- Catalog discovery is scoped to the configured proxy key and cached per credential scope (agent dir, workspace dir, auth profile id, and base URL).
- The proxy key is attached only at request dispatch; it is not stored in model metadata.
- Automatic attribution and request-correlation values are trimmed and control-character rejected before dispatch. Attribution values are bounded to 256 characters; request ids are bounded to 128.
- Model transport diagnostics contain metadata only and never include the proxy key or model content.
- Native Anthropic and Gemini model ids are rewritten to their upstream ids only at dispatch.
- Unsupported or ungranted catalog rows fail closed and are not selectable.
