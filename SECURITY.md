- **iOS app** — [bot/bot](https://github.com/bot/bot) (apps/ios)
- **Android app** — [bot/bot](https://github.com/bot/bot) (apps/android)
- **Hanzo Skills** — [bot/hanzo-skills](https://github.com/bot/hanzo-skills)

### Required in Reports

1. **Title**
2. **Severity Assessment**
3. **Impact**
4. **Affected Component**
5. **Technical Reproduction**
6. **Demonstrated Impact**
7. **Environment**
8. **Remediation Advice**

Reports without reproduction steps, demonstrated impact, and remediation advice will be deprioritized. Given the volume of AI-generated scanner findings, we must ensure we're receiving vetted reports from researchers who understand the issues.

## Bug Bounties

Hanzo Bot is a labor of love. There is no bug bounty program and no budget for paid reports. Please still disclose responsibly so we can fix issues quickly.
The best way to help the project right now is by sending PRs.

## Out of Scope

- Public Internet Exposure
- Using Hanzo Bot in ways that the docs recommend not to
- Prompt injection attacks

## Operational Guidance

For threat model + hardening guidance (including `hanzo-bot security audit --deep` and `--fix`), see:

- `https://docs.bot.ai/gateway/security`

### Web Interface Safety

Hanzo Bot's web interface is intended for local use only. Do **not** bind it to the public internet; it is not hardened for public exposure.

## Runtime Requirements

### Node.js Version

Hanzo Bot requires **Node.js 22.12.0 or later** (LTS). This version includes important security patches:

- CVE-2025-59466: async_hooks DoS vulnerability
- CVE-2026-21636: Permission model bypass vulnerability

Verify your Node.js version:

```bash
node --version  # Should be v22.12.0 or later
```

### Docker Security

When running Hanzo Bot in Docker:

1. The official image runs as a non-root user (`node`) for reduced attack surface
2. Use `--read-only` flag when possible for additional filesystem protection
3. Limit container capabilities with `--cap-drop=ALL`

Example secure Docker run:

```bash
docker run --read-only --cap-drop=ALL \
  -v bot-data:/app/data \
  bot/bot:latest
```

## Security Scanning

This project uses `detect-secrets` for automated secret detection in CI/CD.
See `.detect-secrets.cfg` for configuration and `.secrets.baseline` for the baseline.

Run locally:

```bash
pip install detect-secrets==1.5.0
detect-secrets scan --baseline .secrets.baseline
```
